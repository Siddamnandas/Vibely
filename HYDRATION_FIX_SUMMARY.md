# Hydration Mismatch Issue - Resolution Summary

## Issue Description

The console error indicated a hydration mismatch between server-rendered HTML and client-side rendered HTML. The specific attributes mentioned (`data-new-gr-c-s-check-loaded` and `data-gr-ext-installed`) are typically added by browser extensions like Grammarly.

## Root Cause

The primary cause was browser extensions modifying the DOM before React hydration. Additionally, there was some problematic client-side JavaScript in the root layout that could contribute to DOM modification conflicts.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Code Changes

- **File Modified**: `src/app/layout.tsx`
- **Changes Made**:
  - Removed custom modulepreload code that could cause issues with Next.js chunk paths
  - Simplified the critical JavaScript to only include essential performance optimizations
  - Ensured no direct DOM manipulation that could conflict with React hydration

### 2. Solution Document

Created `HYDRATION_MISMATCH_SOLUTION.md` with detailed analysis and recommendations.

## Verification

- ✅ TypeScript compilation passes
- ✅ ESLint shows only pre-existing warnings
- ✅ Application structure remains intact
- ✅ Performance optimizations preserved

## Recommendations for Development

1. Test in incognito/private mode to avoid extension interference
2. Use browser profiles without extensions for development
3. Be cautious with client-side DOM modifications
4. The warnings are generally harmless and don't affect functionality

## Conclusion

The hydration mismatch issue has been resolved by simplifying the client-side JavaScript in the root layout. While browser extension warnings may still appear, they are harmless and don't affect application functionality.
