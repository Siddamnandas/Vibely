If you encounter issues:

1. **Check the tunnel status**:

   ```bash
   npm run show-spotify-config
   ```

2. **Verify the setup**:

## Technical Details

The authentication flow works as follows:

1. User clicks "Connect to Spotify"
2. Application redirects to Spotify's authorization endpoint
3. User authenticates with Spotify
4. Spotify redirects back to: `/auth/success?provider=spotify&code=AUTH_CODE`
5. Client-side code exchanges the authorization code for tokens via `/api/auth/spotify/exchange`
6. Tokens are stored securely and user is authenticated

All components of this flow are properly configured and functional.
